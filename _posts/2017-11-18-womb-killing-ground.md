Satan hates you and wants you to kill your children.

The Bible describes how pagans used to sacrifice their babies to Molech and Baal by making them "pass through the fire."

"And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin" (Jer 32:35).

Note well what our sovereign and all-knowing God says about this satanic ritual: "I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination."  God's will has nothing to do with this.  We are talking about ultimate evil here, conjured by the demonic impulses of men to satisfy their own lusts and whore after other gods of their own making (Exo 34:16).

Very few people toss their babies into flaming fire today. These days, people either chop up babies in the womb or, if they're too big to extract, burn them up by injecting a chemical solution into the amniotic sac that slowly cooks them over time to soften their flesh like meat in a crockpot.

That's not the language we usually use, of course.  We're much more sophisticated than that.  The wicked couch their sacrifices in clinical terms.  Abortionists use stainless steel instruments like the dilator, tenaculum and curette to open the cervix, grab the baby and cut him or her into pieces.

Okay, that's graphic and gruesome, but you might be wondering how abortions can really be equated with human sacrifices to idols.  Certainly, no mothers actually kneel before a bull-headed statue on an altar when they drop in at the local Planned Parenthood clinic next to the mall for a minor out-patient procedure.  So let's try to understand the nature of idols in our lives today.  Here's a short list:

* Your career
* Your schooling
* Your reputation
* Your stretch-mark-free figure
* Your bank balance
* Your so-called freedom

These things might mean the world to you.  You may think these things make up your life, but they're idols sitting in the place of God in your life. To serve these idols, women, and those who advise them, [sacrifice babies](http://www.worldometers.info/abortions/){:target="_blank"} on the order of 125,000 per day worldwide and 3,000 per day in the USA. Satan couldn't be happier with our dedication to serving his will against God's.

Lots of people now acknowledge the human status of the fetus (Latin for "offspring"), which would have decimated the case for abortion in Roe v. Wade back in 1973.  Unborn babies can no longer be dismissed as mere "clumps of cells" as they were once considered, so, putting that question to rest, the discourse of abortion advocates has retreated to an argument for women's rights to control their own bodies, the underlying reason being that our patriarchal society wants to subjugate women and control the most intimate aspects of their lives.  The lamentable position for pro-choice advocates is this: a pregnant woman, as an autonomous being, has the right to eliminate her unborn child because it currently resides within *her* body and not *yours*.  For aborted babies, it's literally a case of having no voice and being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

To address the issue of a woman's right to kill a baby living in her womb, let's consider the question of autonomy. Are any of us really autonomous?

Obviously, a baby inside its mother's womb isn't autonomous. Some pro-abortion advocates say these babies aren't "viable" outside the mother's body, by which point they seek to show that the baby isn't a real human being on account of its dependency, its lack of autonomy. As if autonomy were a proof of humanness, which it is not.

Despite the rhetoric from freedom fighters everywhere, none of us are autonomous.  Without even considering God's role in our lives, the plain fact is that circumstances, conscience and consequences all prevent you from acting with autonomy.  You have the freedom to make choices according to your desires, yes, but those choices are always limited by your situation and consideration for other people, and you're not free to make the consequences of those choices.

If one limiting factor to our autonomy is consideration for other people, nonetheless, this limit is often budged according to the rule of *might makes right*, which is the sad truth behind the popular calculus for abortion.  In the name of empowerment, presumably and ironically to correct a social injustice against women, we give mothers the power to kill the truly powerless ones who depend on them for everything.  We've taken the sacred and loving protection of the mother's womb and turned it into a killing ground.

Pregnancy and motherhood are indeed seriously challenging responsibilities in all dimensions: physical, emotional, financial and social.  The Bible affirms the pain and struggle of motherhood.  God cursed Eve and all women after she ate of the tree of knowledge of good and evil:

"Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee" (Gen 3:16).

It has become abundantly clear to me that this verse provides the reason for women to resent not only men because of their easy seed-providing role in childbearing, but God Himself for cursing all of womanhood for the transgression of Eve, the first woman.

The Satanic Temple, a secular humanist organization that fights against Christianity, has made promoting abortion one of its top priorities, right alongside campaigns for discouraging faith in God among kids.  The clear point is, abortion figures highly in the satanic mindset that seeks absolute freedom from God's law and judgment.  For satanists, their personal rebellion will end in defeat immediately after their death, of course, when they will be handed over to their father the devil to suffer with him.  They'll get just what they're asking for: separation from God, forever.

God commands us to break down our altars to false idols, which are not gods at all but the work of our own hands, and to worship Him alone in Jesus Christ as the way, the truth and the life.

Abortion is murder, and murder is a sin, but Jesus makes forgiveness available to all sinners. God is merciful enough and powerful enough to save even the worst of sinners. This really puts the *amazing* in **amazing grace**, and God, through His Son, offers it to all.
