It must seem like hell on earth for you right now. Your shining careers have crashed and burned. The same world that has lauded and celebrated your work all these years is now turning against you.  Your communities of fans, friends and loved ones are now transformed into torch-wielding mobs because you've let them down, you've failed to live up to their expectations, your past crimes have come to light and revealed the sickness dwelling in your hearts.

And you know, you deserve worse than any punishment they can deliver.

While this fickle and vindictive world turns against you, the mercy of God is steady and sure. As assuredly as hellfire awaits unregenerate sinners, God waits patiently for all His children to come to repentance.

Not all of you have confessed your crimes, and some of you still maintain your innocence. That needs to change.  No one is innocent, and you have no excuse. You have a sin problem, just like everyone else. Our sins inflict collateral damage on other people, creating a feedback loop, a chain reaction of wickedness. We're all caught in the web of sin.

This may be the darkest moment of your lives, but let me assure you that we're all darkened by sin.  In our hearts, we're all wicked, every single one of us. By nature, we're all perverts at heart, turned away from the truth of God.  We're all murderers at heart, kept from committing heinous acts only by the grace of God.

That's not an excuse.  It's abhorrent and intolerable, and we all deserve hell right here and now.

> Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God (1Co 6:9b-10).

That's the bad news, and here's the crucial good news given to believers in Jesus Christ:

> And such **were** some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God (1Co 6:11).

Some of you have checked into rehab facilities for sex addiction, and some of you say you're seeking treatment.  What in the world does that even mean?  If the name of your treatment center contains a word beginning with "psych-," then you're heading into a spiritual cul-de-sac of pseudoscientific quackery. Turn back and seek the better way.

Only Jesus Christ accomplishes true recovery by lifting up the fallen.  Forget all those twelve-step programs -- this is a one-step program:

1. Repent and believe in Jesus Christ and you will be saved.

That's the one step to recovery, and once taken, it will never fail.  Yes, you will have troubles in this world, but take heart, because your Lord has overcome the world.

I can't promise that Christians will welcome you with open arms.  As individuals, we're all broken by past abuse and sins of our own, and many of us feel a burden to protect ourselves and our families from potential threats. People will not necessarily find the strength within themselves to forgive you, but God certainly will, and by the power of the Holy Spirit some Christians will too.

So I speak only for myself and by the witness of the Holy Spirit and the word of God when I say you will be welcomed into the faith if you sincerely repent and believe in Jesus Christ.  I believe in God's promises, and He is powerful enough to save anyone, even you.

You were born into this world as fallen men, and as celebrities you were raised up as idols, and now you're burning as fallen idols and fallen men. Let your old lives go, and turn to Christ.  Let that man die and be born again of the Spirit of God.
