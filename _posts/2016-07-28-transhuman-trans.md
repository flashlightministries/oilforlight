Ray Kurzweil is a prominent technological idolator, an inventor and futurist who adores technology and worships it as his savior. He believes that through technological advancement we'll soon shed these kludgy meat-suits and transcend into a pure "singularity" of information, a movement called Transhumanism.

Where there's success in the technology industry, transhumanism is sure to be found among its luminaries. Bill Gates has this to say in a blurb for Kurzweil's book, The Singularity is Near:

“Ray Kurzweil is the best person I know at predicting the future of artificial intelligence. His intriguing new book envisions a future in which information technologies have advanced so far and fast that they enable humanity to transcend its biological limitations—transforming our lives in ways we can’t yet imagine.”

Here are some salient points from Kurzweil's prologue to that book:

"At the age of eight, I discovered the Tom Swift Jr. series of books... To this day, I remain convinced of this basic philosophy: no matter what quandaries we face... there is an idea that can enable us to prevail. Furthermore, we can find that idea. And when we find it, we need to implement it... A word on magic: when I was reading the Tom Swift Jr. books, I was also an avid magician... I am often reminded of Arthur C. Clarke’s third law, that 'any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic'... Consider J. K. Rowling’s Harry Potter stories from this perspective. These tales may be imaginary, but they are not unreasonable visions of our world as it will exist only a few decades from now... Essentially all of the Potter 'magic' will be realized..."

Kurzweil consumes hundreds of supplements orally and through IV drip to "reprogram" his DNA to keep him alive long enough to live forever, as a bridge to the time when our technology allows it. He's arranged to have his body and head cryogenically preserved for thawing later if he dies too early. He dreams of bringing his father back to life by uploading mementos -- photographs, writings -- to computer.

Another wealthy and successful transhumanist, Martine Rothblatt, the millionaire founder of Sirius XM, underwent real-life elective sex reassignment surgery. Rothblatt wants eternal life so bad that he invented his own religion in an attempt to achieve immortality through the advancement of technology and worship based on eastern paganism mixed with his own philosophy. Their religio-technological movement, [Terasem](http://www.terasemmovementfoundation.com){:target="_blank"}, creates AI robots to serve as vessels for peoples' uploaded "mindfiles" of their consciousness. The robots are invariably over-sexualized along the lines of Real Dolls.

Transhumanism is a movement propelled by sci-fi/fantasy, magic, industrial power and money. They're children separated from God trying to achieve immortality by their own wits. They're lost.

"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me" (John 14:6).
