Wonka: Donâ€™t forget what happened to the man who suddenly got everything he wanted.

Charlie: What happened?

Wonka: He lived happily ever after.

The Chocolate Factory message:

1. Be good.
2. Get everything you want.
3. Live happily ever after.

Just about everyone believes in 2 and 3, and they tell 1 to their kids. It's like a mental disease. I'm no longer much of a Wonka fan.

It's the prosperity gospel in a nutshell.

What's missing is the true gospel of Jesus Christ:

1. You're not good, and in fact you're depraved and deserve death.
2. God gave His Son to save you, and you can get everything through Him.
3. You can be born into a new life with Jesus, or you can die in your sins.

I like the movie Young Frankenstein, though.
