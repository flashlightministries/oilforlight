A new paper, published in Nature, seems to speak with authority when it declares, "This skull represents a previously unknown species that is the sister taxon to Archosauriformes and which fills a major morphological gap in understanding of early archosauriform evolution."

They call this creature Teyujagua paradoxa: "Teyú Yaguá, literally meaning ‘fierce lizard’, is commonly represented as a dog-headed lizard. Species name derived from paradoxa, Greek meaning ‘paradoxical’, ‘unexpected’, owing to its unusual combination of plesiomorphic and derived characters."

These researchers pose a serious paradox indeed -- the findings of this paper go against the Book of Genesis, which clearly and simply describes how creation came about, told from the perspective of the only being who was there to witness it: God (Gen 1:1-2).

Based on the Book of Genesis and the genealogies listed in 1 and 2 Chronicles, among other books of the Bible, we know that the universe is about 6,000 years old.  If the young age of the earth sounds preposterous to you, it's because you've been indoctrinated to believe in Materialism, a philosophy invented by men to deny God and thus avoid confronting their sin in light of his laws (Jn 3:19).

The researchers who wrote this paper estimate that the skull they found is 250 million years old, 40,000 times older than creation.  How did these wise men estimate the age of the lizard dog to be so old?

"An Induan to early Olenekian (Lower Triassic) age is inferred for the Sanga do Cabral Formation based on the presence of Procolophon trigoniceps, and comparisons with the coeval Lystrosaurus Assemblage Zone of the South African Karoo."

Consider the keyword "inferred."  There are a few inferences embedded in that quote, inferences based on theory upon theory, upon layers of circumstantial evidence.  They suffer from the fallacy of uniformitarianism, the belief that natural phenomena have always behaved as they do now.

This is pure Darwinism, macroevolution, and exposes the severe doubt and absurdity that has always suffused that line of thinking.  The scientific method demands that doubt be challenged by experiment and physical evidence, but macroevolution lacks even the most rudimentary evidence to support it.  The fossil record shows evidence of microevolution (small variations), not macroevolution (transformational leaps); rock layers reveal the signs of great biblical catastrophes such as floods, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, not macroevolution; and carbon dating does not account for variations in isotopic decay rates over time.  Macroevolution is pure blind faith, unlike biblical belief, which is illumined by the Holy Spirit that indwells believers and shows them the truth of God's glory (Jn 14:26, 16:13-16; 1Co 1:21).

Rather than scoffing at God's biblical truth as preposterous, unbelievers ought question why they favor this finding of a mythical dog-headed lizard monster from 250 million years ago to be the reasonable explanation instead.  They find it more sensible to believe the dragon story they received from a magazine called Nature, because it was written by men they trust, than to believe the Word of God, because they have not accepted Jesus Christ, and they have not received the Holy Spirit (1Co 1:18, Eph 1:18).

Here's how the researchers confidently express the shaky grounds of their own beliefs:

"However, the origins of this clade and its extraordinarily successful body plan remain obscure ... the acquisition of this highly successful cranial morphology from more primitive reptiles is poorly understood due to the patchy and fragmentary nature of the early archosauriform fossil record, and the absence of key transitional taxa showing intermediate morphologies."

They appear to feel no distress over their epistemological condition of perpetual research based on obscure, patchy and fragmentary evidence, never reaching understanding, never seeing the light of truth, but only developing evermore abstract theories that lead them deeper and deeper into darkness (1Co 3:19).

They use the word "successful" to conform to their Darwinistic belief system, which professes "survival of the fittest" and pure dumb luck as the two organizing principles of nature.  Revealing their spiritual impoverishment, materialists worship matter and numerical chance as the bringer and maintainer of life instead of God, instead of the one who possesses perfect wisdom and sovereignty over creation (Col 1:16).

One researcher writes, "Teyujagua lived in a devastated world and was part of a ‘lucky’ branch of the tree of life that survived the greatest mass extinction of all time."

The greatest mass extinction of all time occurred only a few thousand years ago with the flood, written about in the Bible (Gen 6-9).  Those who survived the devastation were aboard Noah's ark, and we're their blessed descendants.  The birds who also survived -- in the language of the paper discussed here, those sharing the dog-headed lizard's branch of the tree of life called Archosauriformes -- were not "lucky" to have survived, however, since luck plays no part in God's sovereign plan (Prv 16:33).  Luck is a fundamental part of materialist philosophy, not God's plan.  Instead of thanking luck, believers thank God that he saved us, and that he made a covenant with every living creature to never destroy the world again with water (Gen 9:8-17).

With water, mind you.  In the end, he will instead destroy the world with fire (2Pe 2:10-13) and cast the wicked into the lake of fire with Satan (2Pe 3:7; Rev 20:10, 15).

That's the bad news.  The good news is that God's children in Jesus Christ will be saved (2Ti 4:18; 2Pe 3:9-13).  [Add more.]
