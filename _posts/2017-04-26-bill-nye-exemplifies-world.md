I won't post a link to Bill Nye's recent Netflix episode about the "sexual spectrum" because the Bible advises the faithful to avoid "profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called" (1 Timothy 6:20b).

Suffice it to say, he's outdone himself and disgraced the term "science" by promoting a model of human sexuality based on feelings, and topping it off with a song-and-dance performance glorifying graphic and perverted sexual acts that resembles Miley Cyrus on MDMA. The whole episode is weird and creepy. Perhaps Nye has jumped the shark with this one.

Referencing Genesis 1:27 and 5:2, Jesus said, "Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female" (Matthew 19:4b). This is so obvious to everyone. Paul elaborates,

"Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them. For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, and changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things. Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves: who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen. For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: and likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet" (Romans 1:19-27).

As it was then, so it is now. "The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun" (Ecclesiastes 1:9).
