The difference between cross-dressing and full "gender reassignment surgery" is only a matter of degree: presenting a false appearance by putting on deceptive makeup, clothes and accessories is functionally equivalent to mutilating the flesh for that purpose.  It's always a lie, an illusion, and one that can sometimes fool the wearer as assuredly as the observer.

Having a womb transplanted into a man does not transform him into a woman, but it does introduce a new twist on the abortion issue: men will soon be able to defend aborting children by chanting, "[My Uterus My Choice](https://www.google.com/search?q=my+uterus+my+choice&tbm=isch){:target="_blank"}."  Is this progress?

Fundamentally speaking, however, none of this is new.  The Deuteronomic Code of the Israelites restricted transvestites from the priesthood, saying cross-dressers "are abomination unto the Lord thy God" (Deut 22:5).  Certain men in the ancient world had their testicles crushed and their penises cut off, sometimes in worship to heathen deities (Deut 23:1).

Illusions have always been the tools of the trade for sorcerers and pagan cultists "who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator" (Rom 1:25a).  The creatures typically worshipped often have transgender attributes representing naturalistic duality, evidenced in Gnostic, Baphometic and Hindu idols, all in denial of God's order from the beginning to have one man and one woman united in marriage (Mat 19:4-6).

*Pretend* literally means "to stretch out in front of," like wearing a false skin, or dressing up a corpse and laying it out for presentation.

These days, we use the word *pretend* for a child playing make-believe.  Check out [this commercial](https://www.popsugar.com/moms/Halloween-Commercial-About-Gender-Nonconformity-44185728){:target="_blank"} normalizing "gender nonconformity" in children, in fact praising cross-dressing children as heroes in their parents' eyes.

Children think and do weird things because they're still developing.  Parents need to help direct the paths of their children, not sit back and marvel at their confused expressions of gender fluidity.

"When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things" (1Co 13:11).

Adults are acting like confused children.  Grow up.  Play time is over.  A life dedicated to celebrating pride is a life heading to destruction (Pro 16:18).

We face deep moral consequences for allowing *whatever* to transpire when people live according to their own lusts, and that goes for raising our kids as well as preaching the truth in love to anyone we see living in enmity against God.  It's not love to abandon people to their wicked lusts in the name of diversity and tolerance.  Such acceptance and encouragement of sin is the worst kind of hate: a satanic impulse.  People tend to live as man-pleasers rather than God-pleasers, and we can only overcome this tendency through the power of the Holy Spirit.

Voluntary gender-bending, which is just one of many sexual perversions invented by man in rebellion against God, has always been a sin -- but the good news is, anyone can be forgiven, washed clean and justified by the grace of Jesus Christ.

God loves you not as you are, but as you can be in Jesus Christ (Rom 5:6-11).
