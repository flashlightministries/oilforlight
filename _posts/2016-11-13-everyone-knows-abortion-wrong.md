In the wake of all the election unpleasantness (for it does seem like someone has died and we're mourning at a wake), I'm sure we can all use a break from contentious issues. Abortion seems like a light topic, so I'll talk about that.

First, from a logical-secular perspective, then from a biblical perspective centered around the book of Romans.

We all know in our hearts that life begins at conception, but not everyone can admit it. To explain by way of some simple questions to ask yourself,

What is pregnancy, if not the process of bearing new life beginning from the point of conception? What is being aborted, if not the pregnancy? Who is the mother making the "choice" to abort, if not the mother of a new child, who has no choice?

Honestly answering these questions leads to only one conclusion: that abortion is equivalent to murder.

Admitting these facts about abortion can complicate the practical aspects of our lives and choices. The top three reasons I hear in support of aborting a pregnancy are (1) protecting the life of the mother, (2) rape/incest of the mother and (3) poverty of the mother.

Choosing to end the life of the child before he or she is born really can avoid these hard problems. Sometimes bringing life into the world will cause so much suffering that we choose to annihilate it instead. The cold fact is that we tend to favor the people we know and see over the invisible ones. That's a natural bias.

So like I said, not everyone is willing to admit that it's murder. Pro-choice is a euphemism for pro-euthanasia, like putting an animal to "sleep," but in the case of abortion, the patients suffering the incurable and painful condition are ourselves, who continue to live on. We justify the murder in order to serve the "greater good."

In this respect, pro-choice is comparable to vigilante justice, though not identical. Again, let me explain from a logical-secular point of view.

Let's say you alone witness a horrific crime being committed. Not to be graphic, let's further assume that the perpetrator is a high-ranking cop in a corrupt police force and the victim is a small child. You know that if you reported the crime, the police would drop the case and probably arrest you under some false crime. Finally, assume that you're soon after confronted with the opportunity to murder this pedophile cop by running him over with your car.

Do you commit the murder in this case? Many would, and they would say the murder is "justifiable," because they can justify it to themselves. This is the comparison I would draw with abortion, that many people justify the murder to themselves. But with abortion, pro-choice advocates are further deluded into thinking it's not even murder.

Why is murder wrong? This question is impossible to answer from a logical-secular perspective, even though many have tried and even find their answers rational and acceptable (such as survival of the species, the existence of a universal and mysterious morality code, societal order, or simply because it feels right).

From the biblical perspective, which I strongly advocate, we can see the right answer for why most people know murder is wrong.

"For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law. They show that the work of the law is written on their hearts, while their conscience also bears witness, and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even excuse them" (Romans 2:14-15).

This concept is known as "common grace," and it serves to care for creation by restraining sin in man's conscience, for unbelievers and believers alike. God has made Himself known plainly to everyone, but many suppress that truth in unrighteousness (Romans 1:18-22).

We're all sinners, every one of us (Romans 3:10). We all suffer tendencies toward lying and various lusts, for example. As they say in AA, admitting that you have a problem you cannot control is the first step to recovery...

Even though we're all sinners, unable to save ourselves, anyone can be saved by the moving of the Holy Spirit, if God wills it. This is what believers pray to happen in unbelievers, and why disciples preach the gospel to everyone, because the word of God preached is the power of God that brings salvation (Romans 1:16).

Children are born innocent, but they have a sin nature and will invariably begin to sin soon enough (As Job said long before God's law was given to Moses on tablets of stone, "Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one"). Further, to demonstrate the innocence of a very young child, Jesus insisted on letting the little children come to Him, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as them (Matthew 19:14). So the murder of an unborn child is always unjustified according to God's law, because these particular souls are wholly innocent when they're put to death.

If you're pro-choice, you can change your mind and God will forgive. If you've committed abortion, you can repent and God will forgive. If you choose not to change -- if you choose not to put your trust in Jesus Christ who gave His life to pay for your crimes -- you will get the punishment you deserve for the crimes you've committed. It's a matter of justice, and God is just and always renders justice.

As for the abortion issue in terms in politics or false religion, the world will always fumble over such issues of frightful evil. That's a Bible promise. We live in a fallen place, a domain given over to Satan. But we who follow Christ bear a greater promise, thank God, and look forward to its fulfillment.
