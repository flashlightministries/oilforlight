Fairy tales and sci-fi rule the minds of our "best and brightest," who are always quick to disparage the biblical worldview as fantasy.  Psychologists call this behavior *projection*, but the Bible calls it *idolatry*.

Two examples of magical thinking emerged today, showing again that scientism is anything but scientific.

First, on a new compound theorized to be responsible for transforming inorganic matter into life, the [senior study author says](https://futurism.com/scientists-may-have-found-the-chemical-compound-that-started-life/){:target="_blank"}, "It reminds me of the Fairy Godmother in Cinderella, who waves a wand and ‘poof,’ ‘poof,’ ‘poof,’ everything simple is transformed into something more complex and interesting."

Second, [Stephen Hawking says](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2017/11/06/stephen-hawking-issues-stern-warning-on-ai-could-be-worst-thing-for-humanity/#24aee153a7c0){:target="_blank"}, "AI could develop a will of its own."

Their blind faith in macroevolutionary theory necessarily divorces them from reality and leads them to believe that fairy tales can come true, sometimes for good (all life arising out of dead matter by chance), sometimes for evil (AI developing a consciousness and destroying us).

It seems as if these spiritually-deprived souls were sent to bed reading godless fairy tales and never woke up.
