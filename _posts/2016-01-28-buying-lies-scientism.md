Creationists are fond of pointing out that evolution is just a theory, a point that enrages anyone who respects the scientific method. This is a tired old argument for them.

The average fan of science will readily assert that science doesn't even claim to deal with truth, but rather, it deals with viable conjecture proved through experimentation.

Evolutionists usually respond to the creationists this way: Did you know that gravity is a scientific theory too? You believe in gravity, right? So there you have it -- evolution is just as proven and well-understood as gravity, so just shut up about it already, you Bible-thumping lunatics.

The problem here is that science knows nothing about gravity that you don't know from high school physics. Basically, mass attracts mass according to a certain ratio. That's about it. Let's get our terms straight:

Science identifies gravity as a "force," which is a word used in science meaning, roughly, "something that exists that science doesn't understand at all." It's a lot like the Force in Star Wars -- a mysterious, ungraspable aspect of nature that pervades all of space and exerts its influence on matter.

The etymology of "influence" is noteworthy here. The word derives from astrology, referring to an inflowing of ethereal power from the stars that acts upon our character and destiny. When scientists use the word "force," they are indeed talking about a woo-woo concept like astrology. They don't know the first thing about it; they don't really know what's going on. Scientists think they have a *handle* on these forces because they can sort of measure them.

Scientists are required to establish the existence of natural constants in the universe in order to make their equations work, but it turns out that none of these constants are actually constant. They change.

The gravitational constant, Big G, is really hard to measure, first of all, and secondly, it keeps changing. Since Newton first measured it in 1687, the value of Big G has steadily increased ever since. Scientists periodically conduct Big G measurement experiments all over the world, then take the average and adjust the value of Big G accordingly.

Big G has never been a stable value, and yet they consider it a constant. Science relies on other fake constants, too.

Consider the forces of isotopic decay and hyperfine transition frequencies of caesium-133. On second thought, don't consider that, because it's all gobbly-gook jargon of theory upon theory, but do note that scientists use these measurable phenomena to establish just about all of our units of measurement.

The meter, the kilogram, the joule, the second, hertz, the speed of light -- all the SI units -- are based on the tick-tick-ticking of the caesium-133 isotope. E=MC^2 only seems elegant because the whole system of measurement is circular -- it's a tautology.

The speed of light, assumed to be constant and based on caesium-133, is used in radiometry for estimating the age of the universe. The decay rate of carbon-14, which is assumed to be constant, is used to perform radiocarbon dating for estimating the age of the earth.

These radioactive phenomena aren't stable, but science takes them to be constant. Scientists have demonstrated a billion-fold acceleration of radioactivity in the laboratory, for instance. Radioactivity has been shown to vary with solar activity, for another.

Are constants real, or have we only identified local, recent stability? Have physical properties always behaved as they've behaved over the last few hundred years? That's the assumption from physicists, which is a blind leap of blind faith, and counter to experience and experiment. But scientists measure everything according to this assumption of stability, so they're left without a stable foundation for measuring anything.

Going back to Descartes, Bacon (mmm, bacon), Locke, Newton and other preeminent "enlightenment" philosophers from the 16th and 17th centuries, we've been convinced that we can't be convinced of anything but the viability of our scientific theories. This has left us floating free without any frame of reference. The floating sensation may feel good if you keep your eyes closed, but once you realize what's happening, it'll make you nauseous.

Physics tells us that every effect requires a cause, but this leaves them without a coherent explanation of the creation of the universe itself, a first cause. It's a simple dilemma that a 9 year-old can point out, and yet the smartest minds in the world can't even get close to resolving it without collapsing into incoherency.

The problem is that the "enlightenment" was a terrible darkening of our minds, and we won't find our way out without a light. We've traded out the God of divine revelation for a fake god of rational skepticism, and we think we know more than ever, but we've dumbed ourselves down into God-doubting imbeciles who believe our own hypothesized fantasies.

God is not an effect and he needs no cause. The only Big G constant is God, and you can know absolute truth by knowing him. The Bible is privileged information revealed to believers by the Creator himself. God is your stable platform from which you can view the world and all of its glory. God is the Creator and you are his creature. He gave you ears to hear his Word (Matt. 11:15) and eyes to see the world, so listen up, open your eyes and learn about his creation, starting with Genesis. (Not the Phil Collins band, but the book.)
