Modern theories of the moon's origin began with Charles Darwin's son, George, who in 1898 postulated that in ancient times the rapidly-spinning earth ejected the moon due to centrifugal force, leaving a pit in our planet we know as the Pacific Ocean.

That idea held sway for decades, but since the 1970s, scientists have been favoring an adjusted theory known as the Big Whack (AKA the Big Splash, or the giant-impact hypothesis, or to follow the tradition of naming theories after Greek mythology, the Theia Impact, coined in 2000, which has the advantage of lending a proper name to something that's never been observed, as if it really existed), whereby an unknown early protoplanet the size of mars impacted the earth and expelled a bunch of debris into orbit that later coalesced into the moon. According to this story, it all took place about 20-100 million years after the formation of the solar system 4.5 billion years ago.

The article shared here adjusts the Big Whack theory again to assert that the impact was high-energy enough to vaporize everything, including the earth itself, creating a cloud of whatnot that later cooled into the earth and moon we have now.

Undergirding all this conjecture is unfaith, a strong belief in unbelief, that is, a distrust in God's word in favor of man's shifting understanding.

The Darwin family going back generations was largely Unitarian, tending toward deism if not atheism, so a penchant for theorizing on godless origins was in their blood. Charles was born with his grandfather Erasmus' theory of evolution already on the table, and when Charles attended the second voyage of the Beagle, he was merely looking for evidence in support of that theory.

So it's not surprising that we find Charles' son George proffering theories about the moon's origin that favor conjecture over God's word about creation.

Scientists today inherit both Charles Darwin's theory of evolution and George Darwin's lunar origin hypothesis as starting points for their own creation stories, which change whenever a majority of researchers finds the current story wanting and would favor a new twist.

Not many scientists are buying into this latest moon origin story, but as the researcher in charge of the theory states optimistically, "It will take time for people to accept a new idea." He knows the pattern.

Believing these stories is like building your house on shifting sands rather than a rock. Jesus tells a parable about that:

"Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock: and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock. And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand: and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it" (Matthew 7:24-27).

Going back further, to words spoken to Moses that resonate on multiple levels, "And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock" (Exodus 33:21).

Even more crucially, believing in these godless origin stories is nothing less than idolatry, which is a required activity if you reject God.

J.C. Ryle said in 1879, "Any worship whatever is more pleasing to the natural heart, than worshiping God in the way which our Lord Christ describes, 'in spirit and in truth' (John 4:23)."

We're all inveterate worshippers. The question is, do you worship the living God or the idols of your own making?

Paul gives some simple advice that was once etched in stone as a commandment but should now be written on your heart: "Flee from idolatry" (1 Corinthians 10:14b).
