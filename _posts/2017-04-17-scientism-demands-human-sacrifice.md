Which religion instructs its adherents to renounce the luxuries of life on the earth in order to reach a glorious existence out of this world? Which religion says you need to risk your life to get a chance for renewed life?

Many religions impress those requirements upon their followers, but not Christianity. The Bible says you're saved by faith in Jesus Christ alone, and not by your works.

The religion I'm thinking of in this case is Scientism, the belief that the power of scientific knowledge and our cunning techniques will deliver us to paradise. Coupled with technology and industrialism, this religion has captured the imaginations of many (most?) people in the developed world. Eastern mysticism and postmodern relativism are jumping-off points for this religion, but the typical Scientistic believer isn't that self-aware. They just really like Star Trek, and Carl Sagan, and Elon Musk...

Here's an article on that point, asking believers in Scientism to sacrifice a bit of their enjoyment of life here on earth to save up for a trip to Mars that in all likelihood will cause their death.
