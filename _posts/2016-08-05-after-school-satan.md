The [After School Satan Clubs](https://afterschoolsatan.com/){:target="_blank"} clubs may proudly declare themselves to be atheists who stand against religion in favor of scientific materialism and free thinking, but they worship false idols just the same. They're indeed satanists, even while they deny Satan's existence. They're confused about the nature of their own belief system, which is a blind faith in the truth claims of various theories and philosophies of man, in direct denial of God's word. That's been Satan's domain since the garden of Eden.

"Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter! Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!" (Isaiah 5:20-21).

"The preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God. For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent" (1 Corinthians 1:18-19).

"The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned" (1 Corinthians 2:14).

"Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it" (John 8:44).

"There shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts" (2 Peter 3:3b).

"Wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat" (Matthew 7:13b).

They'll probably be very popular. That is, until the fashion-conscious mock-and-shock facade fades away and the kids find out they're enrolled in the geekiest pseudoscience club ever. Seeking truth in the likes of Darwin, Dawkins, Hawking and Sagan is like seeking fine cuisine in a box of Saltine crackers.

Here's the kicker:

Jesus said, "But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea" (Matthew 18:6).

Take heed, leaders of the After School Satan Club. Jesus takes the salvation of His little children pretty seriously. Hinder the children from coming to Him and you'll get to meet your hero when you join Satan in the lake of fire.
