The headline reads, _Chan Zuckerberg Initiative announces $3 billion investment to cure disease_.

The idea of a 10-year program to "cure, prevent, or manage all disease" through science funding is almost too absurd for description, so I drew a pie chart to correct their slight statistical error.

"For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord" (Romans 6:23).

Dear Zuckerbergs, Jesus Christ sees your challenge to cure disease and He raises you one better by offering the cure for death.

The quintessential tech-billionaire-philanthropist, Bill Gates, who funds research to find the cure for death through efforts like vaccines and weather modification, spoke at the event, endorsing this new boondoggle launched by his protege, Mark Zuckerberg. No surprise there.

The article ends with a line from Zuckerberg's wife, Priscilla Chan: "We want to dramatically improve every life in [our daughter's] generation and make sure we don’t miss a single soul.”

For Facebook so loved the world that they gave $3 billion, that everyone shall not suffer disease but have eternal newsfeeds filled with posts about Kardashians, kittens and pictures of your friends' lunches.
