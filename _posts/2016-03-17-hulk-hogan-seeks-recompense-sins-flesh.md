> For to set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace.  For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to God's law; indeed, it cannot.  Those who are in the flesh cannot please God (Romans 8:6-8).

Put to death therefore what is earthly in you: sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry.

And many will follow their sensuality, and because of them the way of truth will be blasphemed.

He who commits adultery lacks sense; he who does it destroys himself.

For a prostitute is a deep pit; an adulteress is a narrow well.
