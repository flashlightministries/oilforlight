My brief impression of the pope's "surprise" (pre-recorded) TED talk:

Complete failure to deliver the gospel.

Here are a few more words:

The pope delivered a humanistic message calling for solidarity among all people as a means for achieving a better, happy future on earth through tenderness, humility and the power of love that begins with you.

That's a sweet message, not unlike something you may hear from the Dalai Lama or an after-school special, but it bears no resemblance to Christ's message.

The pope described a hope in ourselves, not one that relies on faith in Jesus Christ alone, and he even claimed this as a Christian hope. "To Christians, the future does have a name, and its name is Hope ... A single individual is enough for hope to exist, and that individual can be you." That's a deplorable misrepresentation of the Christian faith because it puts the self in place of the crucial (!) means of salvation -- Christ!

The pope said, "Solidarity is a term that many wish to erase from the dictionary."

Let's keep the word "solidarity" in the dictionary so that it may be challenged as unbiblical. God is a divider, not a uniter. Jesus said, "Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword" (Matthew 10:34). Jesus speaks of a spiritual sword, His gospel, discerning truth from error. Christ will separate the wheat from the chaff, saving the former and burning the latter in unquenchable fire (Matthew 3:12).

That's a hard message, and yet it is the gospel. The pope would rather contradict the word of God than face the disapproval of unbelievers worldwide.

One might think that the pope would share the burden to preach the word of God at every opportunity, as implored by the apostle Paul in 2 Timothy 4, but one would be wrong in that assumption. The Roman Catholic Church is a man-pleasing institution based on tradition, not the Bible. The pope's all about overlooking the word of God in order to proclaim universal salvation through any broad path other than the narrow one in Christ. He's doing the devil's work, as an antichrist.

Also, let me address the pope's critique of technology. He says technology is focused on products over people, and he hopes that "technological innovation would come along with more equality and social inclusion." What he has in view here is the welfare of people, a vague reworking of technology for people's sake. That's fine as far as it goes, in a Neil Postman-eque vein, but it's secular humanism again, not Christianity. Simply wishing for more "equality" and "social inclusion" in technology (whatever that means) falls far short of meaningfully challenging our godless and benighted pursuit of technological exigency.

We need to prayerfully seek techniques for glorifying God, building His church and evangelizing Christ. I think Christians face exciting opportunities to innovate, rework and deliberately misuse technologies to create works worthy of the kingdom of God.
