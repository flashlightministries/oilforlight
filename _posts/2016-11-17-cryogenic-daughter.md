Who can spot the fallacy in this statement?

"The cost of freezing a body for an infinite amount of time is estimated to be around Â£37,000."

Estimating a finite cost for freezing anything for an infinite amount of time is an exercise in futility.

Aside from that statement, well, let's just say cryonics is a fraud.

The judge said "the case was an example of science posing new questions to lawyers."

Science? There's no science here.

Jesus is the resurrection and the life. Accept no substitutes.
