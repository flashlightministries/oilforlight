This article contains a number of standard Bible-blunders committed by unbelievers:

1. Every man in the Bible is shown to be a sinner except one: Jesus Christ.  It's a simple logical fallacy to assert that the bad behavior of people in the Bible describes the will of God.

2. Jesus fulfills the Old Testament laws transmitted to the Israelites through Moses.  For example, take the woman caught in adultery in John 8.  The scribes and Pharisees say to Jesus, "Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?" (Jhn 8:5).  They're referring to Leviticus 20:10, where the law says to put adulterers and adultresses to death.  Jesus' response has become quite famous, even among unbelievers: "He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her" (Jhn 8:7b).  Since Jesus is the only one who is without sin, He is saying that He alone as God has the freedom to either forgive sinners or condemn them to hell. This is called the New Covenant, and it's better than the Old Covenant because it's established on better promises (Heb 8:6).  The Old Testament law served as a schoolmaster to bring us to faith in Jesus Christ, and now that our justification by faith has come, we no longer need the schoolmaster (Gal 3:24-25). Articles like this make one wonder: would they accuse Jesus of cherry-picking?

3. Unbelievers are in the habit of considering all thoughts to be merely the opinions of men, which would include the Bible itself.  As such, the Bible is scrutinized by them as an Iron Age relic, hopelessly caught in the cultural backwater of sheep-herding simpletons.  The Bible sets itself apart as god-breathed, written by men as they were moved by the Holy Spirit.  You're free to believe or disbelieve that point, but the fact stands that the Bible explicitly claims a different epistemological status than that imposed by unbelievers.

4. One thing that distinguishes the Bible from the Quran and Hadith is that the former does not have God resolving to order believers to fight unbelievers.  If this statement inspires you to point out that the Israelites were told by God to wipe out the Canaanites, then see Point 2.  As Christians, our fight is spiritual and not against flesh and blood (Eph 6:12).

5. The sins committed by men in the modern age are indistinguishable from those committed in the Bible.  This includes the sins of Roy Moore and those who would use the Bible to defend him.  And yes, to dispute in clear terms the conclusion of this article, they are hypocrites and blasphemers.

6. What the Catholics think (and what the Catholic Encyclopedia says about Mary's age) has no bearing on what the Bible says.  Catholics do not believe in the sufficiency of scripture alone in all matters of faith and the church, thereby shifting their beliefs into the manmade realm of error.

7. The Bible in general, and the gospel of Jesus Christ in particular, were not only progressive for their time, but liberating today.  I'm speaking of things like women's rights, abolition of slavery and nonviolence. Only an honest reading of scripture without cherry-picking will reveal this.  The Bible is, after all, for the benefit of believers, not unbelievers.

8. Even unbelievers are given knowledge of God's moral law.  By grace, God has given everyone a sense of right and wrong (Rom 2:14-15).  Unbelievers are fond of claiming ownership of their morality, and they take pride in it, but they cannot account for its source -- and then they use that moral sense to judge God and the Bible.  They're upside-down.
