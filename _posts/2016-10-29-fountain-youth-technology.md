This article from MIT includes the tagline, "Everyone is getting older. Few are happy about it" and it's shilling for a company called Elysium Health.

That really sums up the problem, and logically speaking, there are only two ways to solve it:

1. Embrace aging as necessary to growing, and dying as a natural consequence of living, or

2. Eliminate aging and ultimately achieve immortality. This group of geniuses is taking the second path.

Researchers have shown in the lab that this new pill can extend the lifespan of worms and mice, and soon you'll be able to buy a subscription (not a prescription) for $50 per month. Their founder says it's "useful for health maintenance," and the writer of this article thinks it "could prove profitable." Sweet. Maybe they'll setup a multi-level marketing scheme so we can all profit.

Since aging isn't recognized by the FDA as an indication of illness, a group of academics and venture capitalists are able to bypass pharmaceutical regulations and launch a company to provide their fountain-of-youth snake oil as an over-the-counter vitamin supplement.

Technologists may be the most prideful people in our society. In my view, they occupy the office of pagan temple priests and idol builders, making and representing the objects of popular worship. From that high position, they grow fat heads and believe they can achieve anything they desire, and they literally sell that idea to everyone else. According to them, only technology can and will deliver us from suffering and save us from death. Their faith rests in genetic engineering, nanotechnology, AI, Mars colonization -- a hope placed in technology for salvation resembling Christ's salvific promise but specifically not of Christ -- that is, an antichrist, a technochrist.

This company, Elysium Health, which is named after the pagan place of the afterlife, is selling a simple rejuvenation pill which harkens back to the early days of quack remedies, but in this case they're wearing the vestments of technological clerics. Hailing from MIT and Sequoia Capital, these are hucksters with tech cred. Bioengineering still enjoys a tech bubble boost, albeit more subdued than the dot-com bubble of the 90s. Will these guys make some money? Probably. Will they save anyone from aging and death? Certainly not.

"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me" (John 14:6).

"Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved" (Acts 4:12).

"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life" (John 3:16).
