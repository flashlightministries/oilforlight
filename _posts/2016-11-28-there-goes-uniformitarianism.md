The speed of light (C) is one of those supposed constants in nature that scientists need in order to further advance their other theories.

It is a great leap of faith to believe that any constants exist in nature.

Now a couple scientists are questioning Einstein's basis for his theories of relativity -- the constant speed of light -- and for some reason, the press is promoting their conjecture.

"The pair plan to test their theory using readings from cosmic microwave background radiation..."

Theories never prove anything, but only proffer the most favored notion. The article continues,

"Because this is a theory, as Einstein himself once said, 'no amount of experimentation can ever prove me right; a single experiment can prove me wrong.'"

So true, Einstein.

This news is reporting nothing but a new theory countering an existing theory, but in this case, the existing theory is essential to the rest of theoretical physics.

Theoretical physics is deeply invested in believing that the speed of light is known and constant. We're so confident in the constant speed of light, in fact, that we've based all our other standards of measurement on it -- the second (time), the meter (space), the kilogram (mass) and the joule (energy) are all based on this theoretically constant speed of light. In other words, we've put all our eggs into this one basket, the speed of light. We measure everything from this single point of reference.

Thus the formula **E=MC^2** looks like an elegant law because all the components are based on the same standard. It's a tautology, and it describes nothing but our own circular measurement system.

Crucially, cosmologists depend on the same circular system of measurement to support their theories for the Big Bang, an expanding universe, the age of the world and everything else for that matter. Our notions of time passing at regular tick-tock intervals over eons, and of isotopes decaying with predictable invariability all depend on the speed of light being constant.

Mainline science depends on the principle of uniformitarianism: that natural laws today behave exactly as they have always behaved.  If the theory of a constant speed of light falls, everything else in theoretical physics falls with it.

Materialists (also known as atheists, agnostics and nonreligious rationalists) rest everything on this tottering house of cards. They accept the shifting sands of knowledge as a fact of reality, and when pressed, would assert that absolute truth cannot be known, that everything is relative. It is a deep irony that the same people who accept constants in nature, which is demonstrably in flux, assert that truth itself, which is manifestly anchored by its own definition, is relative and shifting.

They're fools. Jesus said,

"Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock: and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock. And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand: and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it" (Matthew 7:24-27).

The materialist worldview rests on a blind faith in supposed laws of nature like the speed of light, but physical laws that fail are no physical laws indeed.

God never fails, and His laws are eternal. Why would anyone choose to build their house upon the sand rather than a rock, to walk in darkness rather than in the light, favoring the faulty knowledge of men over the perfect wisdom of God?

Jesus said,

"Men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil. For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved" (John 3:19b-20).

With God's wisdom and truth comes righteous judgment, and that's too much for most people to bear. I pray for God to grant you the humility to admit your own sinful nature, and for you to dedicate your life to Jesus rather than your own selfish presuppositions, theories and boastings of science falsely so called. The Lord said to Paul, "My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness" (2 Corinthians 12:9b).

"Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up" (James 4:10).

"Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding" (Proverbs 3:5).

Do you find that hard to believe? Hard to accept? Without the Holy Spirit, it's impossible to accept it. Without God, the truth is unbelievable.

"But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them" (2 Corinthians 4:3-4).

Jesus is the constant speed of light, who is infinite, eternal and unchanging.

"Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever" (Hebrews 13:8).

"That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world" (John 1:9).
