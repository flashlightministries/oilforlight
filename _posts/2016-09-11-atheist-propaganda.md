This article, "Stunning Videos of Evolution in Action," is a faith-based propaganda piece for atheism. According to the writer, the experiment "shows the importance of randomness in evolution 'in a really beautiful way, a way that is easy to visualize and thus hard to deny.'"

The materialist must argue that randomness and time, rather than God, created the universe, life, consciousness and everything. It's a dumb argument, literally relying on dumb luck to explain everything, but this is how God makes the wisdom of unbelieving men into foolishness.

Adaptation through random mutation and selection is not evolution. This experiment doesn't show the creative activity of information generation but rather the filtering of information not unlike marbles settling in the depressions of an uneven planar surface.

In so-called science news like this, we see researchers declaring their "really beautiful" observations and positioning their biased presuppositions as facts that are "hard to deny." Just what does the writer imply with the unsupportable phrase, "increasingly evolving?" Need we wonder why the word "increasing" is employed five times in this short article? The underlying belief is that nature is increasingly becoming more evolved on its own without God, without objective truth, and more to the point, without judgment of sin.

Originally, the experiment was cynically named OMG before more "conservative peers" forced them to change it.

The article ends with the line, "Seeing is believing.‚Äù Have they no shame?

"Nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush" (Jeremiah 6:15b).
