> In 2014, the American Humanist Association filed a lawsuit asking for the cross to be demolished or altered, such as by removing its arms “to form a non-religious slab or obelisk.”

That's how you would transform a cross into a phallic pillar to Baal.

It's a reversal of God's command for the Israelites to break down the pagan temples to Baal: "And they brake down the image of Baal, and brake down the house of Baal, and made it a draught house unto this day" (2Ki 10:27).

Satanists love their obelisks, cubes and slabs.  Such images are **not** religiously neutral -- even if individual humanists think they are.  When you worship the father of lies, you probably don't even know his true identity.

I have no problem acknowledging that we live in a pluralistic society based around a secular government, and that the Constitution supports this notion.  I also acknowledge that it's worldly and wicked for that very reason.  This ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals only demonstrates that fact.

Too many "conservative evangelicals" worship the United States as lord, not Jesus Christ.

Jesus called Christians to live in the world, but not to be of the world (Jhn 17:15-18, 1Jn 2:15).  Jesus did not call Christians to transform the world or the nation into a Christian theocracy, and I'm glad He didn't because we'd just screw it up.  Our citizenship is in heaven, thank God (Phi 3:20).

Let the humanists squabble about cement crosses and Ten Commandments monuments in public places.  I figure it's better than pretending we live in a Christian nation blessed by God.

"While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal" (2Co 4:18).
