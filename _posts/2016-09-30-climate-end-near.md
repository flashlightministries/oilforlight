Climate change believers typically think the science is corroborated by the smartest minds in the world and based on solid evidence, and lately, that this science shows we're doomed. That's what this "Goodbye World" article from Vice's Motherboard is all about.

Climate change deniers typically think it's a liberal conspiracy to control the world through carbon credits and other regulations.

The biblical view is more nuanced. Everyone knows in their heart that we all deserve to be wiped off the earth, and that without God we're doomed. Unbelievers suppress the truth, but the truth still surfaces in strange ways. Though their knowledge of God's judgment to come is shrouded and distorted, they theorize and seek evidence to rationally explain these feelings in ways that leave God out of the picture.

"For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness; because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them. For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools" (Romans 1:18-22).

Climate science is based on viewing the world as a system -- an ecosystem -- that reacts to stimuli in a complex of feedback loops. Climate science is really Systems Theory, which grew out of the study of cybernetics, which views everything like a computer. That's convenient and satisfying, since we invented computers and understand their design completely. Thinking about the world as if it were a massive machine places us in God's position. Unfortunately, even though computers can theoretically simulate nature-like behaviors, nature is nothing like a computer. Climate science is materialism gone wild. It's irrational and wrong, but many people believe it religiously today, thinking they're the rational ones, and they spend their lives trying to conform the world to their blind faith. "Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools."

There's a better way, a way that glories in the righteousness and mercy of God.

"Thus saith the LORD, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches: but let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the LORD which exercise lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I delight, saith the LORD" (Jeremiah 9:23-24).

To an unbeliever, that sounds foolish. "It pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe" (1 Corinthians 1:21b). God loves irony.

It's true that this world is doomed:

"But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up" (2 Peter 3:10).

That's the bad news. Here's the good news for those who believe (also see John 3:16):

"Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness" (2 Peter 3:13).

The way heavenward is not to strive into the outer darkness using rocketry and space travel, or to build towers for that matter (Genesis 11:4ff). There is only one way, Jesus Christ, and He is the truth and life. For those who believe in Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit makes their bodies His temple, delivering them in new spiritual bodies to life everlasting.
