(Just look at that image: a gaggle of reporters fawning over the city's new self-driving shuttle while a giant mechanical praying mantis looms over them.)

A self-driving bus get into an accident within 2 hours of its maiden voyage and humans get the blame.

[Headline](https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/local-las-vegas/downtown/human-at-fault-in-accident-with-las-vegas-driverless-shuttle/){:target="_blank"}: "Human at fault in accident with Las Vegas driverless shuttle"

[Headline](http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/driverless-shuttle-bus-1.4205079){:target="_blank"}: "Human blamed in self-driving shuttle bus collision"

[Headline](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/self-driving-bus-accident-day-las-vegas-article-1.3621441){:target="_blank"}: "Self-driving bus gets into accident on its first day in Las Vegas, human driver blamed for collision"

The city has issued a statement saying, "The shuttle did what it was supposed to do."

A Digital Trends journalist who was aboard when the accident happened [says](https://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/self-driving-bus-crash-vegas-account/){:target="_blank"}, "What the autonomous shuttle bus didn’t expect was that the truck would back up towards it... We had plenty of time to watch it happen.  I was taking pictures... This collision, like 90 percent of traffic incidents on our roads, was the result of human error... Next time you’re in Vegas, give the self-driving shuttle a chance."

Humans are indeed to blame for this minor accident -- and they will be to blame for all future accidents involving autonomous vehicles -- not because humans can't drive as well as robots, but because at root we're surrendering our cognitive freedom to technological idols.

What do I mean by "cognitive freedom?"  Simply this: the ability to shift a car into reverse or to drive around a slow-moving truck when nobody has trained you to perform that particular task.  It's also known as intelligence, which no machine will ever possess or even simulate to a satisfactory degree, and we are to blame for assuming it could and already bowing to its image.  We are even willing to [sacrifice our very lives](http://oilforlight.com/scientism-demands-human-sacrifice) to the technological idol.
