Check out the quotes from the article and compare them to the following Bible passage.

The apostle Paul describes a spiritual journey of faith that follows God's will for us to be not conformed to this world, but to be transformed by the renewing of our minds, while the people polled for Mars visitation wish to confirm their vain imaginings by transforming another planet to conform to their worldly desire for self-actualization.

"I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God. For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith" (Romans 12:1-3).

Because some people think so highly of their human potential, they're willing to present their bodies as living sacrifices to otherworldly technological pursuits to realize their science fiction dreams.

I observe a deep, deep biblical inversion happening among these Mars trippers.

As science fiction apostles like Neil deGrasse Tyson preach, space travel is the only way to inspire future generations of kids to study science, math and engineering. That's the benefit to dedicating billions of dollars, decades of labor and a world of resources to space travel: inspiring education.  Do you think that money and effort could be spent on education in a more direct way?

If you ask other science fiction apostles, such as Stephen Hawking, colonizing another planet is our only hope for the survival of the human race.  They need to put down their sci-fi novels and pick up the Bible for a change.
