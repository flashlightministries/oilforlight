We were talking about proof, evidence and the existential viability of spirit from a materialist perspective -- and now you've jumped to the well-worn hobbyhorse of questioning God's righteousness based on Mosaic law.

We'll go ahead and follow this new direction, since it may edify others.

You said, "You argue that 'God's moral law', the only true ('transcendent' and absolute) morality, derives from the bible. Which must mean you feel free to keep slaves, and stone to death those who have sex when the woman is menstruating; that you are obliged to murder homosexuals, uppity teenagers and those who worship other gods; that you don't work on the Sabbath (Friday evening to Saturday afternoon), and so on and so forth."

Jesus said, "Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil" (Mat 5:17).

Consider what it means to fulfill the law.  It certainly doesn't mean Jesus "did away with all that."  So put away your straw man (I'm sure you beat him regularly without cause) and pay attention to what the Bible says.

I happen to be a Christian, which means I follow the teachings of Jesus Christ.  Jesus said, "For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled" (Mat 5:18).

I follow all of the Bible, from Genesis to Revelation, not just the New Testament.  Jesus quoted often from the Old Testament and used it for correction, rebuke and instruction in righteousness. 

The laws given to the Jews were to set them apart as a holy nation (Exo 19:6).  All of the Mosaic laws were meaningful, then and now, and all of them were shadows of things to come in Jesus Christ (Col 2:17).  Those laws were a schoolmaster to bring us to Christ, so that we could be justified by faith (Gal 3:24).

So let's consider what your schoolmaster is trying to teach you.

First, nobody can follow God's laws perfectly because no one is righteous (Rom 3:10, 3:23).

The wages for sin -- what you rightfully earn for yourself by sinning -- is death (Rom 6:23).  This poses a dilemma, since it would seem our just God would need to punish everyone's wickedness according to their sin.

The Son of God became flesh and dwelled among us, lived a sinless life and provided His own body as a sacrifice to atone for our sins (Rom 5:8).  This is how God shows His love for us.

The Old Testament laws and priesthood of the tabernacle and temple (the ceremonial laws I mention below) teach us how blood sacrifice worked for atonement in Israel.  It was never sufficient, though.  Thank God that we now we have a better covenant in Jesus Christ, legally enacted on better promises (Heb 8:6).

You mentioned a number of Old Testament civil laws given to Israel and Israel alone.  Let's consider the ones you railed against.

The Jews had been slaves in Egypt, and they would be taken into captivity again by Assyria and Babylon.  As Jesus would teach his disciples later, God instructed the Jews through Moses to obey their masters, to not rebel and cause strife.  They shouldn't avenge themselves, but instead rest in God's ultimate justice.  God promised that He would repay, saying "Vengeance is mine" (Deut 32:35).  The Lord will vindicate His people.  All of this is reasserted by the ministry of Jesus Christ, and you already know that part: love your enemies, turn the other cheek, etc.

Slavery in Israel itself, and in the Roman empire, was instituted for civil order.  It did not in any way resemble the chattel slavery of the early United States.  Rather than going to prison to rot for life, criminals were put to work for other people to repay their debts and propitiate the harm caused by their crimes.  People could also enter themselves into servitude for guaranteed support for them and their families, resembling the contractual corporate employment we have today.

The fact that God regulated slavery in Israel to curtail abuse does not mean Christians ought to embrace slavery today.  One doesn't follow from the other.  Yes, it's possible to abuse scripture to support any wicked behavior -- that's a testimony to our God-given freedom -- but such abuse is easy to identify.  Scripture is clear.

The Israelites were given many laws regarding clean and unclean things, and yes, the menstruation of a woman was declared unclean for them.  The word "holy" means to be set apart from unclean things for a sacred purpose, and the holiness ordained for the nation of Israel applied in a literal sense to what all Christians are to follow today in a spiritual sense.

The prophet Isaiah said, "But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags" (Isa 64:6).  The Hebrew word translated as "filthy rags" would be menstrual cloths.

It is just as true today that we're all unworthy to approach God on our own merits because we're unclean.  Only in Jesus Christ can we be treated as righteous before our holy God.

The death penalty for homosexuals applies to today insofar as all sin deserves the death penalty.  Thank God we're not all going to hell as we deserve, but some will be saved by repenting and believing in Jesus Christ.

The same goes for "uppity teenagers" and idolators.  The same goes for liars, thieves and drunkards.

In addition to the civil laws, God gave ceremonial laws to Israel to prescribe their rituals and patterns of worship in the priestly order of the tabernacle and temple.  All of these laws give insight into the ministry and rule of Jesus Christ, who is our perfect high priest: holy, innocent, undefiled, separate from sinners, and exalted above the heavens (Heb 7:26).  When Jesus yielded up His spirit, he tore the veil of the temple that separated the people from the Holy of Holies, allowing every believer to boldly enter into the presence of God (Mat 27:51, Heb 10:19).

You misunderstand basic covenant theology, but you also grossly mischaracterize Jesus' commands to His disciples.

You said, "You constantly go the extra mile, do you?  Sell all you have to give to the poor?  Turn the other cheek?  Give to everyone who asks?  Hand over your shirt when your jacket is demanded of you?  Love others, including your enemies, as yourself?"

Jesus said that if your right eye causes you to lust, pluck it out (Mat 5:29).  Do you really think He was speaking literally?  You can still lust with your left eye, you know.

I really hope you can step back from your hostility against God and consider what I'm saying here about reading the Bible with an honest heart.  It's clear when Jesus is speaking in hyperbole and parable, and it's clear when He's speaking literally.

With the following statements, I don't intend to boast, but like Paul said, since you're putting me in a situation to boast, I'll take advantage of your challenge (2Co 11:16-21).

Do I constantly go the extra mile?  Not constantly, but I'm burdened to try, and I repent when I fail.

Do I sell all I have to give to the poor?  No, not all that I have.  I also need to provide for my household.  But I do give away much that I have.

Do I turn the other cheek?  Yes, often.

Do I give to everyone who asks?  Not all the time: for instance, when someone brings up this point online and then demands that I give them my car or all my money, I do not.

As for loving my enemies as myself, this one can only be accomplished in Jesus Christ.  I preach because I was saved, and it's only love that compels me to preach so that my enemies may be saved.

You said, "If you don't comply with these stipulations... then you've no business telling others they're without foundation for their morality without 'stealing' it from this mythological 'worldview' of yours."

That doesn't follow.  The greatest commandment is to love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind and strength -- and no human has ever obeyed this commandment.  Not for one second.  But Jesus does it without ceasing.  This understanding is core to the Christian worldview.  The fact that I fail, as a man, does not impugn the truth of matters.  I'm not justified in myself, but only in Jesus Christ.  I'm treated as righteous, even though I'm far from it.  That's called imputed righteousness, given by the substitutionary atonement of Christ.  You can call that "word salad" all you like, but words have meaning, and these legal descriptions come with real meaning.  Claiming to be unable to understand what I'm saying, or that I'm jabbering, will not save you.

It stands that you're stealing from my worldview in order to posit a moral code for yourself.  If you claim any understanding of what it means to "do the right thing," then you're stealing.  Your atheistic worldview offers a void, a cold and dark realm of meaninglessness from which you assume sprang all life and the culminating coming of You into consciousness.  That worldview does not offer morality of any sort.  Again, you know this morality in your heart, because God has given it to you by grace, but you cannot square it with your own worldview.

Ask yourself, "Why am I disputing that I steal from this guy's worldview?"

Is it because you think stealing is wrong in any way?  If so, you're stealing from my worldview to reach that conclusion.

Is it because you think you're not stealing according to the definition of "stealing?"  If so, then you claim to value the truth, and again you're stealing from my worldview to assert the value of truth.  A consistent materialist would not care.

At any rate, you're a thief many times over.  Have you ever stolen anything?  How about a pen from the office?  Yes, you've stolen, and you're a thief.  And a liar.  And so am I.

But the difference between you and me is, I've been washed, I've been sanctified, I've been justified in the name of Jesus Christ and the Spirit of God (1Co 6:11).

And being clean, according to Old Testament law and the new covenant, I can approach God and be in His presence for eternity.  Without Jesus Christ, you'll be cast into outer darkness.

I love that you're referencing biblical teachings and saying things like, "please, attend to the log in your eye, my friend."  Since I've been saved, I've removed a forest full of lumber from my eye that would put Weyerhaeuser to shame, and there's always more clear cutting to do.

That said, you're misapplying these teachings about refraining from hypocritical judgment.  I raised the point about God's moral law not to point out that you're not following it, nor to assert that I do follow it perfectly, but that your atheistic worldview doesn't give rise to it.  It's spiritual, and it comes from God.
