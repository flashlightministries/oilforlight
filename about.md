> Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine (2 Timothy 4:2).

T.C. Howitt writes at the crossroads of the gospel and our technological society, using the Bible to illuminate truths about our benighted culture.  He considers no subject sacred in this fallen world, relying on the power of God's word alone to boldly declaim the shocking wickedness surrounding us.

A former enterprise software architect with 20 years of experience, he now endeavors to answer the question, How can Christians live faithfully according to God's will in the modern world?  He's currently working on a book titled, **_The Tower and the Tabernacle: A Biblical Examination of the Power and Purpose of Technique_**.
